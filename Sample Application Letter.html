Dear Peter,
</p>
<h5><b>
Re: Sales Assistant Vacancy (vacancy number 40568)
</b></h5>
<p>
I am writing to apply for the position of Sales Assistant at ABC Clothing Ltd, which was advertised on Trade Me on 14 February 2013.
</p>
<p>
I have enclosed my CV to support my application. It shows that I would bring important skills to the position, including:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
time management and strong organisational skills
</li>
<li>
high-level customer service and friendly relationship management
</li>
<li>
cash handling and sales ability
</li>
<li>
motivation and dedication
</li>
</ul>
<p>
As a Sales Assistant at a busy shoe store, I have been able to build up a strong foundation of customer service skills. Though I have really enjoyed this role, I am looking for a new challenge in my career. The Sales Assistant role with ABC Clothing Ltd would offer me a chance to grow and further develop my retail career.
</p>
<p>
I would enjoy having the opportunity to talk with you more about this position, and how I could use my skills to benefit your organisation at an interview.
</p>
<p>
Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to hearing from you.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Yours Obediently
